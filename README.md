## Description

This project originated as the third undertaking within a comprehensive full-stack development bootcamp. Our aim was to reimagine the concepts inherent in social media and dating applications, focusing them on a common passion: a love for books. Our goal is to foster book lending, creating opportunities for meaningful connections to flourish among individuals who share a profound appreciation for stories.
